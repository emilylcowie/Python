To do this, I used Python to code it and Jupyter Notebook to display my findings.

What I discovered:
- How long I have spent watching Netflix since my account was created
- What I watched most of
- What I searched for
- Various frequencies of shows/movies

*This data is purely used to practice python data analysis skills and should not be used in any other way :)*
