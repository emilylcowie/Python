This repository contains all my code files of when I taught myself Python including:
- The beginnings for coding games
- Manipulating and using lists
- Learning the data types and how to use and return them
- Loops, count-controlled iterations and conditional statements

I learnt the majority of this content through this YouTube video:

For an experienced reader, many of these files are not coded well and are inefficient in their repetition (etc) however, this is simply a compilation of all the projects I did to learn the basics of python. :)
